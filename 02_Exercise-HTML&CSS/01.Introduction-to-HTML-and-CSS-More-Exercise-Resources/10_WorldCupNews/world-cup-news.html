                    The biggest scoreline in the history of the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> qualifiers - and indeed in the history of international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.

                    This legendary match also brought global renown for <em>Archie Thompson</em>, whose 13-goal haul set a new world record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.

                    And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been that it is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, <em>'Next Goal Wins'</em>, showing across the world.
